# Python - Everything is object

![_5cc38c4e-ca9d-404f-bce9-d3e1286902c7](https://github.com/savvyh/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/assets/139894873/c6a5f2a5-b140-40a2-b6cb-2f19f4ad9bd5)

## General üêç

In Python, objects are pieces of memory storing data and methods, while classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. Differences lie between mutable and immutable objects: the former can be changed after creation, while the latter cannot. References are values pointing to objects in memory, and assignment binds names to values. Aliases are alternative names for the same data. Variables are identical if they reference the same object and linked to the same object if they share the same memory address. To display the memory address in CPython, one can use the id() function. Python has built-in mutable types like lists and dictionaries, and immutable types such as integers and strings. Variables are passed to functions by passing references to objects.

## Requierements :teacher:

- Python Scripts : 
    * We are not allowed to import module.
    * Respect the pycodestyle.
    * All files must be executable.
    * Use #!/usr/bin/python3

- Answer Files `.txt` :
    * Only one line
    * No Shebang on the first line (‚Äú#!/usr/bin/python3‚Äù)
    * All files should end with a new line

## Task üíØ

For this project, we just have to write answer on .txt files. 
The aim is to answer Yes or No from the exemple they gave us. We also have to answer little script (just one line) to print result.
There is 28 task like this.

The last project is a blog about "Python3: Mutable, Immutable... everything is object!"
Here are the requierements : 
    - Add an introduction
    - Talk about `id` and `type`
    - What are mutable and immutable objects ?
    - Why does it matter and how differently does Python treat mutable and immutable objects ?
    - How arguments are passed to functions and what does that imply for mutable and immutable objects ? 
    - The post shoudl have many exemple to illustrate what we are explaining.
    - Post the blog on a social media as Medium r Linkedin. I will choose Linkedin.
