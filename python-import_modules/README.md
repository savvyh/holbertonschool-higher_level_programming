# Python - import & modules

## General üêç
- How to import functions from another file ?
- How to create a module ?
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs ?

In Python, modules, import statements, and packages are fundamental concepts that facilitate modular code organization. Here's a brief explanation of each :

1. Modules ü•á
* A module in Python is simply a file containing Python code.
* It can include variables, functions, classes, and other code elements.
* The primary purpose is to organize code by dividing it into separate files, making code management and maintenance easier.

2. Import Statements (import):
* The import statement is used to include modules in a Python script.
* It enables access to variables, functions, and classes defined in these modules.
* There are various ways to use import, such as import module, from module import name, and import module as alias.

You can also create an alias to rename the import program : 


3. Packages:
* A package is a way to organize related modules into a directory hierarchy.
* It can contain sub-packages and modules, forming a tree-like structure.
* The goal is to create a logical and clear organization for large-scale Python projects.

## Requirements üèÅ
* The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* All files must be executable
* The length of files will be tested using wc

### Tasks :100:
- Task 0 : Write a program that import a function from another file, and print the result.
- Task 1 : Write a program that import a function from another file, does some Maths, and prints the result.
- Task 2 : Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
- Task 3 : Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments. The program should also handle big numbers.
- Task 4 : Write a program that prints all the names defined by a compiled module.
- Task 5 : Write a program that imports a variable from a file, and prints its value.
