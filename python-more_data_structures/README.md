PYTHON - MORE DATA STRUCTURES
![_39d54767-ace6-4c9d-991d-0b67cb52a5ae](https://github.com/savvyh/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/assets/139894873/efb139a4-80da-4b3e-87a9-d2dd6a66ecc4)

## General üêç
To follow the previous project about Data Structures, let's move into More Data Structures and talk about Set and Dictionaries :

In Python, both sets and dictionaries are essential data structures that contribute to efficient data management. Sets, being an unordered collection of unique elements, are well-suited for scenarios where distinct values and set operations are crucial. On the other hand, dictionaries provide a powerful key-value mapping mechanism, enabling the association of unique keys with specific values for effective data representation and manipulation. These versatile structures play key roles in solving a wide range of programming challenges, enhancing the flexibility and expressiveness of Python code.

## Requierements üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
* We are not allowed to import module.
* Respect the pycodestyle.
* All files must be executable.
* Use #!/usr/bin/python3

### More data structures üò•
- Task 0 : Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix, `using map()`
- Task 1 : Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
- Task 2 : Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).

### Sets üé±
In Python, a set is an unordered and mutable collection of unique elements. It does not allow duplicate values, making it useful for tasks that involve distinct items. Sets support operations like union, intersection, and difference, providing efficient ways to manipulate and compare data.

- Task 3 : Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
- Task 4 : Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
- Task 5 : Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

### Dictionaries :books:
Dictionaries in Python are versatile data structures that store key-value pairs. Each key is unique and associated with a specific value, enabling quick retrieval and modification of information. Dictionaries are particularly valuable for representing structured data and creating mappings between related pieces of information in your programs.

- Task 6 : Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys. Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order.
- Task 7 : Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
- Task 8 : Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
- Task 9 : Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
- Task 10 : Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
- Task 11 : Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
- Task 12 : Technical interview preparation: Not allowed to use google :ok_person: Create a function that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.
