# PYTHON - DATA STRUCTURES
![_198a1f88-e436-410a-a8e6-a8cd3acd3dc4](https://github.com/savvyh/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/assets/139894873/c832a5ed-cd9c-4bd9-a622-e996ee41d27d)

## General üêç
Python provides various built-in data structures, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries, to organize and store data efficiently. These structures allow you to manage and manipulate information in your programs. Understanding how to use these data structures is essential for effective coding and problem-solving in Python :
 - Discover Lists
 - Discover Tuples

## Requierements üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- We are not allowed to import module.
- Respect the pycodestyle.
- All files must be executable.
- Use #!/usr/bin/python3

### Lists üö•
In Python, a list is a dynamic and ordered collection of elements. It allows you to store and manipulate multiple values within a single object. Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them by adding, removing, or changing elements. They provide flexibility for managing and organizing data in your programs.

* Task 0 : Write a function that prints all integers of a list, use str.format() to print integers.
* Task 1 : Write a function that retrieves an element from a list. If idx is negative or idx is out of range, the function should return None. Not allowed to use try/except.
* Task 2 : Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position. If idx is negative or idx is out of range, the function should return None. Not allowed to use try/except.
* Task 3 : Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
* Task 4 : Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list. If idx is negative or idx is out of range, the function should a copy of the original list.
* Task 5 : Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string. Return the new_string, and we are not allowed to use `str.replace()`
* Task 6 : Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

### Tuples üåµ
Tuples are similar to lists but with a key difference ‚Äì they are immutable. Once created, the elements in a tuple cannot be altered. This makes tuples suitable for storing unchangeable data, such as coordinates or fixed information. They offer a reliable way to represent and handle specific sets of values in your Python code.

- Task 7 : Write a function that adds 2 tuples. Returns a tuple with 2 integers with specific conditions.
- Task 8 : Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character. If the sentence is empty, the first character should be equal to None.
- Task 9 : Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list. We are not allowed to use `max()`
- Task 10 : Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list. Return a new list with True or False, depending on whether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2
- Task 11 : Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list. If idx is negative or out of range, nothing change (returns the same list). Not allowed to use `pop()`
- Task 12 : Write a function that switchs 2 values. The program should be exactly 5 lines long.

Here is the start of Data Structures, let's move on the next project that talk  about more data structure as Dictionnaries and Set !
