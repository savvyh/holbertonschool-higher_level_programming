## General üêç
Tests are crucial components of software development, serving to verify that code functions correctly and to catch bugs early in the development process. Through interactive tests, users can directly engage with software to validate its behavior and ensure it meets requirements. Writing comprehensive docstrings aids in creating effective tests by documenting test cases within the function's description, providing clear examples of expected outcomes. Furthermore, thorough documentation for each module and function enhances code readability and understanding, facilitating maintenance and collaboration among developers. When creating tests, basic option flags enable developers to specify which tests to run, control verbosity levels, and configure test behavior. Additionally, finding edge cases, such as boundary conditions and extreme inputs, is essential for robust testing, ensuring that software behaves correctly under various scenarios and preventing unexpected behavior in production environments. Overall, tests, accompanied by well-written docstrings and documentation, are indispensable tools in software development, enhancing code quality, reliability, and maintainability.

## Requirements üíæ
#### Python Script : 

* We are not allowed to import module.
* Respect the pycodestyle.
* All files must be executable.
* Use #!/usr/bin/python3

#### Python Test Cases : 

* All test files should be inside a folder tests
* All test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
* All tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
* All modules and functions should have a documentation

## Tasks :100:
